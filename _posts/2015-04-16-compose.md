In a [previous post](http://blog.devbot.net/composition) we touched on factors that need to be considered when structuring your applications. In this article we'll go into more detail, take a look at the [Compose] framework and how composition can be made easier. I'll explain some of the more _advanced_ concepts involved when taking a look at IoC, not just DI, and we'll introduce some cool features _Compose_ can provide for you.

## What's _Compose_?

_Compose_ is a lightweight [NuGet package] designed to extend or replace your existing choice of Dependency Injection container in order to assist you in creating clean, isolated components that _correctly_ invert dependency flow.

The API is based upon the ASP.Net MVC OWIN startup patterns many are already familiar with, and are very simple to learn if not. We also provide [additional packages] such as [Compose.ServiceExtension] which will create the necessary files and boilerplate code required to get you started.

## It's just a DI Container?

No. There are enough fantastic DI containers out there; [Ninject], [Autofac], [Unity] to name a few. Compose does provide Dependency Injection, but it does so by wrapping [Microsoft.Framework.DependencyInjection]; a clean open source library being developed as part of the work on [vNext].

_Compose_ extends the new DI Infrastructure, allowing your services to be written with nothing more than references to System namespaces, only involving _Compose_ in your composition root or application host to bring things together cleanly. You can of course bring your services together yourself without any reliance on Compose, but you'd be missing out on some great features!

## Transitioning

Have you ever had a cloud or third party service go down that your software relied upon? Have you ever wanted to component or integration test the entirety of your application or service but needed to switch out just a couple interface implementations to feed in test data? Have you ever wanted to switch your services at runtime?

A key feature of _Compose_ is the ability to _transition_ your services whilst your application is running. More importantly, it allows you to do this without making any changes to your code. Any service registered through the Microsoft dependency injection framework can be marked as _Transitionable_ during registeration using one of the helper extensions provided. From there on, you can simple call `app.Transition<ISomeService, DifferentImplementationOfSomeService>()`.

Anywhere in your application that is already consuming `ISomeService` will start using the new implementation.
