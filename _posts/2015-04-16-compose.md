In a [previous post](http://blog.devbot.net/composition) we touched on factors that need to be considered when structuring your applications. In this article we'll go into more detail, take a look at the [Compose] framework and how composition can be made easier. I'll explain some of the more _advanced_ concepts involved when taking a look at IoC, not just DI, and we'll introduce some neat additional features Compose can provide for you.

##What's _Compose_?

_Compose_ is a lightweight [NuGet package] designed to extend or replace your existing choice of Dependency Injection container in order to assist you in creating clean, isolated components that _correctly_ invert dependency flow.

The API is based upon the ASP.Net MVC OWIN startup patterns many are already familiar with, and are very simple to learn if not. We also provide [additional packages] such as [Compose.ServiceExtension] which will create the necessary files and boilerplate code required to get you started.

##It's just a DI Container?

Nope. There are enough fantastic DI containers out there; [Ninject], [Autofac], [Unity] to name a few. Compose does provide Dependency Injection, but it does so by wrapping [Microsoft.Framework.DependencyInjection]; a clean open source library being developed as part of the work on [vNext].

_Compose_ extends the new DI Infrastructure, allowing your services to be written with nothing more than references to System namespaces if you prefer, only involving _Compose_ in your composition root or application host to bring things together cleanly.
