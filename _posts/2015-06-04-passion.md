I was reading a [blog post] by Aidan Fitzpatrick recently, and as is often the case whilst scouring the web for endorsable blog authors, felt some sympathy for the misinterpretations or poor experience I assume Aidan to have been through. I don't believe the experience of trying to improve oneself and their code but failing and thus falling back to old ways, is a particulrly uncommon phenomenon. So it seems appropriate to address some of the points Aidan has raised, in an attempt to help and perhaps even reinspire those suffering similar circumstance, fallen to the wayside in their endeavour for excellence.

## Clarity

There is often some confusion with regards to _clean coding_ (the them typically used by [Uncle Bob] to describe _"good code"_). There exists several [principles, patterns and practices] to assist developers in achieving excellent code. These range from the static [24 OOP design patterns], through the ever growing and adapting array of practices, and the core [SOLID principles].

As a senior developer mentoring juniors, it is crucial that we expose and pass on these teachings. As James Old's blog post [bad code is the first step to good code] correctly identifies, Junior developers will regularly misinterpret these practices, stumbling through their work attempting to _correctly_ apply these practices. This is where your years of being a developer truly shines; a senior developer knows where to draw the lines. The last thing we want is to end up with an [enterprise fizz buzz]!

But that doesn't mean we should sacrifice any code quality! The patterns and practices must still be used, the principles adhered to, the tests written first. That should be obvious, you're a professional, not a _script kiddy_, right?

## The _Best Way_

It's a question we're often posed. 

> "What is the best way to do this?"

That answer differs by so many factors, an experienced programmer with extensive knowledge of clean coding, _just knows_. We're aware of the downfalls of future proofing, but understand the extensibility afforded through clean code. We know if we just follow some very simple principles, we give ourselves the best chance of victory against the onslaught of the weird and wonderful, ever changing requirements.

The best programmers collaborate and keep up to date with the technologies applicable to their field. They've heard about the latest _buzz_, evaluated and indentified use cases, and learned when and when not to use technologies. They have the common sense to spend some time spiking and prototyping before introducing new dependencies to a product. They have the ability to communicate concepts to the team and the mental strength to accept the outcome of collaboration.
