The term "abstract" is thrown around often within the realms of programming. There are numerous resources that explain the various interpretations of "abstract" as well as usages thereof. I know it's something I commonly refer to, and would like to ellaborate on. Not only to better explain the principle and usage, but also to offer tips on how to introduce _abstractions_ into your otherwise, rotting products.

## Definition

A [quick google](https://www.google.co.uk/#q=define%20abstract) reveals that the word "abstract" can be used in adjective, verb, and noun forms, each with more than one meaning. No wonder there's some confusion!

So what is it we mean when we're talking about _abstractions_?

## `abstract` class

Of course, we have the `abstract` keyword which can be defined on a class declaration and the methods of such a class. When declared against the class itself we are stating that the class **must be inherited**, and subsequently instances cannot be constructed for the `abstract class` itself.

Similarly, the `abstract` keyword when used with a method means that the method signature must be fulfilled by derivatives (classes inheriting from the abstract class that are not themselves abstract).

Although there is some relation, this `abstract` keyword is typically not what is being referred to when people mention _abstractions_.

## So what is it?

To understand this, it may be best to examine Object-Orientated Programming. A term I'm sure you're familar with, but in itself hosts a great deal of confusion as interpretations have emerged over the years. One of, if not _the_ father of OOP, is [Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) whom [described the term](http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay_oop_en) as follows:

> OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things.

Let's examine the first of his points, _messaging_.

## Messaging

I am in agreement with [JÃ¶rg W Mittag's excellent interpretation](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/253121) and research.

> Implementation-wise, messaging is a late-bound procedure call, and if procedure calls are late-bound, then you cannot know at design time what you are going to call

> Messaging is fundamental to OO, both as metaphor and as a mechanism.

> If you send someone a message, you don't know what they do with it. The only thing you can observe, is their response

For me, this is the premise of _""abstraction""_; it should be the goal of you and the code you write. I find it fascinating that the father of OOP had this amazing vision for what he later regrets not having called "message-orientated programming", but now so many, barely understand the core principles.

## Re-envisioned & Re-visited

Much later in the relatively short lifespan of software development, a group of engineers got together to discuss and ellaborate upon a number of concepts, and to put together guidance for the current and future generations. This _[gang of four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)_ put together what has now been refined to the 24 Creational, Behavioural, and Structural [design patterns of OOP](http://www.oodesign.com/).

Then came along everyone's favourite, [Uncle Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin), delivering to us the 5 core principles in the shape of [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)). **All** of these principles, relate back to _abstraction_, if not as predecessor to a principle, then as proponent and guidance.

It beggars belief at times just how few within our field are aware of these things. But that is not the fault of our juniors and newcomers, it is the fault of our seniors. The lack of mentoring, collaboration, and propagation of knowledge.

## I Digress

We now have all these little pieces of information, but still no firm grasp of what is is abstraction *means*. Of the many well structured definitions there are out there which describe abstractions, I'll go with my own account:

> Abstraction is the technique employed to remove unnecessary implementation detail in order to provide a relevant clean context for consumers.

How do we remove unnecessary implementation detail? Simple, we abstract the implementation. Be that be interface or be class...
