This article is intended to guide you and your company through the process of setting up and making contributions to open source projects, as well as hosting your own repositories. The intent of this particular setup is to accredit and allow acknowledgement of a developers' work, but retaining a control of what is published into the wilderness.

It is a process I have used successfully in the past, and although might seem long-winded as presented here, once you are accustomed to it, it is very fluent and simple to follow. Although the guide itself will walk you through elements relating exclusively to [GitHub](http://github.com), the concepts themselves I'm sure can be carried over to alternatives so as [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org).

_NB: I natively type in **British** English but will throughout this article be referring to steps in GitHub which uses **American** English. I can but <del>apologise</del> apologize for the mix of spellings herein._
