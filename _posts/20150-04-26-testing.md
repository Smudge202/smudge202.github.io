I find it easy to fall into the trap of wondering how it is so many people can misunderstand testing. Sure, it's a broad subject and there are far too many (_wrong_) opinions on the subject. But then, it's easy to forget how I was also so very wrong not that many years ago. I too, thought of tests as an optional extra, afforded only to the rich and powerful, not those of us slogging it out in the pits of legacy code, or those of us rushing releases for a new startup.

You'll note, I use the term _us_. I too have in the past, and will continue to work within complicated environments and scenarios. _You_ do not have some _special_ mitigating circumstance that suffices as an excuse to not follow _good_ testing practices; choosing to skip testing is simply unprofessional. The work of the uneducated or worse, lazy, regardless of your title or experience.

##Angry?

That last sentence hit you? Is it not your fault that the culture of your current company doesn't support testing? Is it not your fault that the customers and project managers require releases faster than can be provided when including tests? Is it someone elses fault your legacy code base doesn't have a structure that supports component isolation? Is it someone else's fault for writing a framework you rely on that doesn't support dependency injection?

**You are to blame**.

It most definitely is your fault. Your responsibility. You are the let down, the weakest link. But regardless of situation, of excuse, the situation can be salvaged by _you_.

##_Time_ for change

The most common issue people raise when being introduced to testing, be that TDD or comprehensive suites of Unit, Component, Integration, Load, Stress, Penetration testing, is time.

That's not the fault of the tests. That is _your_ fault. You have set that expectation! We have to break that cycle, and start being professional.
