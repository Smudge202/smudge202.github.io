Even those that work outside the realms of IT are unlikely to argue against the fact that our field is fast moving, so I assume I'd be hard pressed to find a software developer that wouldn't attest to our changing times and the difficulties of keeping up with the latest technologies. Much too many technologies in my opinion for it to even be plausible to keep up with all of them. As a _Professional_ Software Developer, I believe it _expected of me_, that I know as much as possible about the technologies in use in my day to day work, that I know of and have perhaps tried out technologies in the plausible pipeline of the company's plan, and of course I'm keeping ontop of any core technologies and frameworks that are perhaps not in use, but are prevalent in the industry.

As is the tradition of this blog, I have a gripe to get off my chest; a moment's rage if you will...

## Expectations

The first point in the above some of you will pick up on, was the phrase "I believe it _expected of me_". Perhaps I'm expecting more of myself than is necessary? To which I ellaborately respond, no.

It wouldn't be one of my blog posts if I didn't quote the illustrious Uncle Bob at least once, so here's this issue's quote of the day:

> the number of programmers [doubles] every five years
_Uncle Bob's [My Lawn](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/06/20/MyLawn.html)_

Uncle Bob describes the exponential rate of growth regarding the number of Software Developers, and how this presents a tremendous issue in our industry whereby knowledge is not being adequately shared between us, effectively reducing the overall competence of our sector over time! So, as a Senior Developer I take it upon myself to not only do my day job, and to keep up with technologies, but also to teach. Teach, teach, teach like there's no tomrrow. If [The Letter](https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/01/12/The-Letter.html) is anything to go by, there very well may be no tomorrow!

I admit, I don't write as much code as I used to or in fact as I'd like to some days. Something I've noticed as a result of all the tutoring and more supervisory styled collaboration I end up doing, is that the diversity across developers as to what they believe is expected of them. Many of the views I so [strongly hold](http://blog.codinghorror.com/strong-opinions-weakly-held/) I don't anticipate others sharing. Let's face it, I wouldn't need to hold those views so strongly if everyone was in agreement! However, that _Professional_ developers are expected to try and keep up with the moving times, is one I don't think can, nor should be argued.

## Practical Example

Some 4 or 5 years ago, a colleague 

Some years ago, and for a short period of time, I served with Her Majesty's Forces; specifically I was a Tank Crewman for the Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank, in the [2nd Royal Tank Regiment](http://www.royaltankregiment.com/en-GB/default.aspx) (yes, _shooty shooty_, not a mechanic or tech guy). With the forces, and I think this holds true quite broadly across the globe, when you "sign up", you commit yourself for a number of years. At the time, if I remember correctly, the minimum service time was around 4 years and 3 months for my chosen role.
