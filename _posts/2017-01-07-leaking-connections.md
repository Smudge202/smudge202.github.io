I tweeted a thank you to the guys over at [Seq](https://getseq.net/) recently because _Seq_ was instrumental in finding and eliminating a very difficult issue I came across. But technology choice alone isn't enough, so I've decided to blog about some of the logging practices I tend to follow as a rule, and some specific practices that I used in a particularly complex application I've been developing over the last couple of months.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Logging best practices and <a href="https://twitter.com/getseq_net">@getseq_net</a> have been an absolute god-send for tracking down tricky problems.
