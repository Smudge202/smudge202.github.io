Quite some time ago, following a short and shallow [review](http://blog.devbot.net/industry/) of the game development industry, I started writing a game; [Clean Space](http://blog.devbot.net/clean-space-introduction/). Work on the game is ongoing and I have learned an incredible amount so far. Whilst I'll happily talk the ears off of anyone in proximity that shows but a hint of interest, I've done very poorly at writing down some of the lessons I've learned throughout the course of Clean Space's development. So, in this article, I want to talk about *"The Game Loop"*, how it fits into major Game Engines, and why I very quickly came to the conclusion that it is **wrong**.

## Concept

Let's start with describing what exactly the Game Loop is. Anyone that has written a game will have come across this very well known and widely adopted pattern of game development. I don't want to spend particularly long on this because authors like [Bob Nystrom](https://twitter.com/munificentbob) have some really [great content](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html) on game loops, why they exist, and how they solve certain problems.

The premise however is something along the lines of the following:

![game loop](../images/game-loop.png)

Unlike event driven frameworks where you respond to a user driven event, games cycle through frame by frame, each time looking for what user inputs have been registered, then processing the game state, before rendering (drawing onto the screen) said state.

There are of course variations to this which accommodate different usages and alleviate certain problems, but that's the crux of it.

Within the game loop, access is provided in one way or another to a *delta time* which indicates for how long the game has been running. With this information, you should be able to determine the state of each entity (i.e. knowing an in-game car is travelling at a given speed in a given direction, and having been provided how long the game has been running, you can calculate where exactly the car should be and draw/render it at that location).

## Game Engines

Game Engines, paraphrased from [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine) are:

> Software frameworks designed for the creation of games. The core functionality provided by game engines include rendering engines, physics engines, collision detection, sound... *and a whole lot more*.

Long story short, they're complicated beasts working hard to make game development as *accessible* as possible. The maths behind a lot of game mechanics, especially rendering, is mind boggling. A game engine can abstract that away and provide far simpler interfaces.

I work primarily in C#, so the biggest engines of relevance (and therefore the only 2 I'll talk about throughout the rest of this article), are [Unity](https://unity3d.com/), and [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/).

Whilst the API surface differs wildly between these two frameworks, they both operate Game Loops. Unity hides the loop almost completely, but evidence of it is still apparent in the [MonoBehaviour](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html) class *"from which every Unity script derives"*. This class has a broad range of methods and event mechanisms you can latch onto within the execution of the loop, but the most obvious (and probably common) of these is the [`Update` Method](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Update.html).

The signature for the method is completely vanilla:

```csharp
void Update();
```

And access to the aforementioned *delta time* is achieved through the static `Time.deltaTime` (don't get me started on the casing...).

MonoGame by contrast has a much more obvious loop sat in the class that derives from [Game](http://www.monogame.net/documentation/?page=T_Microsoft_Xna_Framework_Game):

```csharp
void Update(GameTime gameTime);
```

Instead of accessing a *delta* from some `static`, the [`GameTime`](http://www.monogame.net/documentation/?page=T_Microsoft_Xna_Framework_GameTime) (correctly cased...) is passed to the update method.

I'll state now that I vastly prefer the MonoGame API over Unity, not just because Unity refers to **code** as *scripts*, or because Unity hasn't come across a C# convention for properly naming and casing members, nor even because most of Unity's examples and documentation uses Java formatting conventions. It's because I've found MonoGame a lot more extensible, and given the problems I highlight below, the ability to extend (and *correct*) certain aspects is very important to me.

## I/O

It basically isn't possible to write a game that completely avoids I/O. At the very least, the game will need to be loaded from disk at some stage. However, more importantly, whilst not unavoidable, it would be extremely problematic to avoid I/O within the game loop (if you were to follow the conventions prescribed by most game engines). Any time you read or write to disk or network, you involve I/O.

Traditionally, the read/write operations were what we called *blocking* operations. That is, a computational *thread* would have to sit and wait for the operation to complete (be blocked) until it continued execution. Fortunately, this problem was solved in Windows at least many years ago with the introduction of [*I/O Completion Ports*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365198(v=vs.85).aspx) (or *IOCP* for short).

For more than 5 years now, .Net has had [`await/async` functionality](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/async) that makes utilising IOCP all but child's play. And yet, looking back to the game loop signatures I described above, IOCP is at best a second class citizen of these game engines; I am yet to come across an API in either of the game frameworks that utilises `async/await`.

The reason for this, I would speculate, is the complexity of [`SynchronizationContexts`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.synchronizationcontext(v=vs.110).aspx). UI's are very particular, in an attempt to protect themselves, about which thread can access and manipulate them. If a game engine were to introduce such mechanisms it would be easier for the UI thread to get lost during execution of a loop iteration, and I expect their forums and issue trackers would be inundated with sync context issues.

However, if you're comfortable with these threading mechanics, it becomes a nuisance that the APIs are all but prohibitive of async usage. We'll call this problem number one.

## Dependency Injection

I'm not going to waste time explaining the benefits of dependency injection (DI) here. I consider it a must have, and I consider [service location](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/02/03/ServiceLocatorisanAnti-Pattern/) completely unacceptable. Neither of these very mature game engines however are at all supportive of DI in the slightest.

Both engines instantiate themselves slightly differently depending on the platform your developing against. If we use *Universal Windows Platform* (UWP) as a common denominator, available as a platform in both engines, I'll explain how the engine's dependency structure by default either requires a fairly hefty fork (in the case of the Open Source MonoGame), or an awkwardly positioned [composition root](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/07/28/CompositionRoot/).

In the case of MonoGame (Xaml), application initialisation is as follows:

```csharp
// App.xaml.cs
//  - OnLaunched event
protected override void OnLaunched(LaunchActivatedEventArgs e)
{
  // ...
  rootFrame.Navigate(typeof(GamePage), e.Arguments);
  // ...
}

// GamePage.xaml.cs
public GamePage()
{
  // ...
  _game = MonoGame.Framework.XamlGame<Game1>
    .Create(launchArguments, Window.Current.CoreWindow, swapChainPanel);
}
```

Where `Game1` above is the start of your game code. The MonoGame (Core) variant of the above is similar (though simpler):

```csharp
public static class Program
{
  static void Main()
  {
    var factory = new MonoGame.Framework.GameFrameworkViewSource<Game1>();
    Windows.ApplicationModel.Core.CoreApplication.Run(factory);
  }
}
```

In both of these cases, I'd at the very least like to DI my `Game1` class. In fact, I'd even go further than that and in addition to having the Game itself constructor injected to help me with game intialisation, I'd also want the means to convention inject the `Update` method with a *frame-scoped* container. That is to say, I'd like to be able to do the following:

```csharp
public class Game1
{
  public Task Update(Logger logger, MyService foo, MyOtherThing, bar)
  {
    // have the services be scoped to the frame
  }
}
```

So what's preventing this? Well if we take a look at the constructor of `Game1` (auto-generated from the MonoGame templates) we'll see the following:

```csharp
public Game1()
{
  graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this);
}
```

The `graphics` field we assign the new [`GraphicsDeviceManager`](http://www.monogame.net/documentation/?page=T_Microsoft_Xna_Framework_GraphicsDeviceManager) to isn't actually used in the rest of the template, so you might think you can just throw that line of code away. You'd be wrong:

> System.NullReferenceException: 'You must create the GraphicsDeviceManager in the Game constructor!'

*(Actually, in UWP Core you won't get any exception at time of writing, the program will just terminate)*.

To further hamper matters, the `GraphicsDeviceManager` constructor contains the following lines:

```csharp
public GraphicsDeviceManager(Game game)
{
  _game = game;
  _game.graphicsDeviceManager = this;
}
```

And the `Game.graphicsDeviceManager` property is `internal`. Anyone that has done a good amount of dependency injection will tell you that two classes depending upon one another is unattainable, akin the age old *'chicken vs. egg'* adage.
